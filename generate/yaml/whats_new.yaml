  # 2023 -----------------------------------

  - title: "New Class: Humanoid Robotics (CMPEN 497)"
    year: 2023
    desc: We study the kinematics and dynamics of state-of-the-art, programmable humanoid robots from principles of physics, computer vision, and AI to physical simulations and executions on real humanoid robots. We also explore the use of stability analysis in motion.
